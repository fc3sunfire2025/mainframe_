Welcome to my collection of Mainframe Tips, Tricks, Howto's, 101 info

This is meant to be a reference tool and a 'duh' reminder for even seasoned Sysprog's. Let's not pretend we have this all memorized, we need a good,

are not written in a way that any reasonable smart person is able to learn from.
